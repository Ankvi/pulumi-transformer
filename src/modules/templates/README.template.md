# Pulumi Azure Native ${NAME} sub package

This package has been generated by [Ankvi](https://github.com/Ankvi)'s [pulumi
transformer](https://github.com/Ankvi/pulumi-transformer) project.

The project splits the [Pulumi Azure Native](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-native)
npm package into smaller, more manageable packages that won't break your TypeScript
server because of too high memory usage.

This project will not cover bugs that should be solved by Pulumi, but if there's
anything wrong with the output, feel free to raise an issue so it can be fixed as
I do not have the capacity to test out all of the features, only the ones my
team uses.
